# Credit Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to predict loan default risk using LendingClub financial data.

Objective
Predict whether a borrower will default and identify key financial risk factors.

Tools Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Approach
Data cleaning and feature selection
Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
Handling class imbalance
Model evaluation using confusion matrix and ROC curve

Key Findings
Debt-to-income ratio is the strongest default predictor
Lower income borrowers show higher risk
Financial stress indicators drive loan failure
Class imbalance impacts recall in risk prediction
Model Performance

ROC-AUC: 0.69
Demonstrates moderate predictive ability under real-world imbalance conditions.

Conclusion
The project highlights realistic credit risk challenges and emphasizes recall-focused evaluation over raw accuracy.
